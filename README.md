# portChecker
port checker using multithreading

When you run it, you will get the opened ports and what is hearing in those ports in order for you to make your analisys.

To test it, edit the portCheckerTest.py and change the yoursite.com for the site that you want to check.

It has three optional parameters:

initPort=1 -> you can start for the port that you want (1 by default)
endPort=200 -> you can finish in the port that you want (200 by default)
threads=20 -> number of threads (20 by default), you can change in order to make your speed test
